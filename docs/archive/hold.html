    Worked on an unreleased app called Docsketch which is an electronic
    signature signing app similar to HelloSign or RightSignature. Using React I
    created the ability for a person to drag and drop signing elements onto an
    uploaded document in order to specify what needs to be executed for the
    signing. For example dragging a date from the sidebar onto the document
    would specify a date needed to be added by one or both parties. The drag and
    drop was provided React's DnD library and all of the advanced features both
    of it and HTML 5 drag and drop api were utilized so that the user interface
    was intuitive and worked as expected.

    Harvard Law commissioned End Point to build an app called H2O which is a
    platform for creating, sharing and adapting open course materials. While
    this app was adapted for many other institutions initially it allowed
    Harvard Law Professors to upload PDF copies of US court cases that would be
    part of the curriculum for Harvard Law students. I worked on an annotations
    feature which allowed a professor to share annotations of a document to
    their class as well as allowing a student to add their own annotations.
    There was a versioning component to this that also allowed viewing
    annotations at different points in time.
